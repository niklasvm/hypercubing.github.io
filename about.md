Hi there! Welcome to my site!

I'm Niklas and I'm a Data Science enthusiast currently working in the fintech industry in Cape Town, South Africa.

I have an honours degree in Quantitative Finance and Statistics from the University of Cape Town. After graduating I joined a boutique asset management company as a quant where I built financial models and strategies. In 2015 I did [Andrew Ng's Stanford Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) which sparked my interest in machine learning initiated my journey to become a data scientist. In 2016 I joined [Jumo.World](http://jumo.world) as a Decision Scientist where I build predictive models for decisioning processes such as credit risk and fraud.

I have been an avid R user for the last 10 years.
